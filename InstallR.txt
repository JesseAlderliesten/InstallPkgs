#### Introduction ####
File with installation instructions for R, RStudio, and RTools on Windows.



#### R ####
Download R from a nearby CRAN-mirror (https://cran.r-project.org/mirrors.html,
see the section 'CRAN mirrors' in the file InstructionsPkgs.txt for some
details) or from the main page (https://cran.r-project.org/) via 'Download R
for Windows' > base > 'Download R-X.X.X for Windows' and install it.



#### RStudio ####
Download RStudio Desktop (https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/) and
install it.

To make work portable and reproducible, go to Tools > Global Options
> General and deselect the option 'Restore .RData into workspace at startup' to
prevent using hidden user-made changes.

Optionally, modify keyboard shortcuts at Tools > Modify Keyboard Shortcuts,
e.g., change the shortcut 'Run current line or selection' from 'Ctrl+Enter' to
'Ctrl+R'.

The appearance of code can be changed at Tools > Global options > Appearance. I
use RStudio theme 'Modern', Editor font: 'Consolas' (also fine: 'Lucida Console'),
Editor font size 11, with a dark Editor theme 'Tomorrow Night Bright' (default:
'textmate'; alternative with a white background: Xcode). When testing for fonts,
https://fonts.google.com/ can be used to compare different fonts, and the string
1lI|i/ 0ODo S5Z2B8 UUVVW uuvvw cldrnm __gqy417 can be used to check
for unwanted similarities between different characters (with symbols
num one, lower el, upper I, vert bar, lower I, slash [next group]
num zero, upper o, upper d, lower o [next group]
upper s, num 5, upper z, num two, upper B, num eight [next group]
double upper U, double upper V, upper double-u [next group]
double lower U, double lower V, lower double-u [next group]
lower c + lower el, lower d, lower er + lower en, lower em [next group]
double underscore, lower g, lower q, lower y, num four, num one, num 7



#### Rtools ####
Before installing and updating R packages, download Rtools from a CRAN website
(see above) via 'Download R for Windows > Rtools' and set it up using the
instructions given there. Rtools is needed to compile source packages, e.g.,
when installing a package from GitHub that is distributed as a source file or
when installing old package versions from CRAN, and to execute scripts that
contain calls to scripts written in compiled code such as C or Fortran to speed
up code execution.
