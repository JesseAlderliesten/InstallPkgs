#### Introduction ####
This file contains instructions on installing and configuring R, RStudio, and
RTools on Windows, as well as links to documentation and help on R and RStudio.
It was created by Jesse Alderliesten, see https://github.com/JesseAlderliesten.


#### Installing and configuring R ####
Select a nearby CRAN mirror website at https://cran.r-project.org/mirrors.html
(see the section 'CRAN mirrors' in the file InstructionsPkgs.txt for some
details) or use the main CRAN page (https://cran.r-project.org/) and download R
via 'Download R for Windows' > 'base' > 'Download R-X.X.X for Windows' and
install it.

R can be configured by changing general options, options for startup, and
options for installing packages, which are documentated at help("options"),
help("Startup"), and help("install.packages"), respectively. 'Startup' and
'install.packages' are also discussed in the section 'Add-on packages' of the 'R
Installation and Administration manual' available at
https://cran.r-project.org/manuals.html.


#### Installing and configuring RStudio ####
RStudio is an integrated development environment for R that can be downloaded
from https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/.

To make work portable, start RStudio, go to 'Tools' > 'Global Options' >
'General' and deselect the option 'Restore .RData into workspace at startup'.

Keyboard shortcuts can be modified at 'Tools' > 'Modify Keyboard Shortcuts',
e.g., to change the shortcut 'Run current line or selection' from 'Ctrl+Enter'
to 'Ctrl+R' so it can be used with one hand.

The appearance of code can be changed at 'Tools' > 'Global options' >
'Appearance'. I use Editor fonts 'Consolas', 'Cacadia Mono Light', or
'Lucida Console' with dark Editor theme 'Tomorrow Night Bright' (the default
light theme is 'textmate', another nice light theme is Xcode).

The following string groups together characters that are similar in appearance
and can be used to check if characters can be properly distinguished from each
other, for example at https://fonts.google.com/ or https://fonts.adobe.com/:
71lI|i/ oO0D S5 Z2 B8 ijy4 gq __ UVVW uvvw cldcIdc|dc1d rnm " '' ``

The pangrams 'a quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog' and, in capital
letters, 'THE QUICK BROWN FOX JUMPS OVER THE LAZY DOG' can also be used.

The string consists of the following numeric (num), lower case (lower), and
upper case (upper) characters:
num 7, num 1, lower L, upper I, vertical bar, lower I, slash /
lower O, upper O, num 0, upper D / upper S, num 5 / upper Z, num 2 /
upper B, num 8 / lower I, lower J, lower Y, num 4 / lower G, lower Q /
underscore, underscore / upper U, upper V, upper V, upper double-U /
lower U, lower V, lower V, lower double-U /
lower C, lower L, lower D, lower C, upper I, lower D, lower C, vertical bar,
lower D, lower C, num 1, lower D / lower R, lower N, lower M /
double quotes, single quotes, single quotes, backtick, backtick


#### Installing and configuring Rtools ####
Rtools (the toolchain bundle used for building R packages from source) is needed
to install old package versions from CRAN, to install packages from GitHub that
are distributed as source files, and to execute R-scripts that contain calls to
scripts written in compiled code such as C or Fortran to speed up code
execution.

Before installing or updating R packages that require Rtools, download the
version of Rtools appropriate for the installed R-version from a CRAN website
(see section 'Installing R' above) via 'Download R for Windows' > 'Rtools' > 
'RTools X.X' and set it up using the instructions given there.
