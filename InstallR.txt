#### Introduction ####
File with installation instructions for R, RStudio, and RTools on Windows.


#### R ####
Download R from a nearby CRAN-mirror (https://cran.r-project.org/mirrors.html,
see the section 'CRAN mirrors' in the file InstructionsPkgs.txt for some
details) or from the main page (https://cran.r-project.org/) via 'Download R
for Windows' > base > 'Download R-X.X.X for Windows' and install it.


#### RStudio ####
Download RStudio Desktop (https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/) and
install it. To make work portable and reproducible, go to Tools > Global Options
> General and deselect the option 'Restore .RData into workspace at startup' to
prevent using hidden user-made changes. Optionally, modify keyboard shortcuts at
Tools > Modify Keyboard Shortcuts, e.g., change the shortcut 'Run current line or
selection' from 'Ctrl+Enter' to 'Ctrl+R'.


#### Rtools ####
Before installing and updating R packages, download Rtools from a CRAN website
(see above) via 'Download R for Windows > Rtools' and set it up using the
instructions given there. Rtools is needed to compile source packages, e.g.,
when installing a package from GitHub that is distributed as a source file or
when installing old package versions from CRAN, and to execute scripts that
contain calls to scripts written in compiled code such as C or Fortran to speed
up code execution.
