#### Introduction ####
This file gives instructions for the installing and configuring R, RStudio, and
RTools on Windows. It also includes a check for fonts.



#### Installing R ####
Select a nearby CRAN mirror website at https://cran.r-project.org/mirrors.html
(see the section 'CRAN mirrors' in the file InstructionsPkgs.txt for some
details) or use the main page (https://cran.r-project.org/) and download R via
'Download R for Windows' > 'base' > 'Download R-X.X.X for Windows' and install
it.



#### Installing and configuring RStudio ####
Download RStudio Desktop (https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/) and
install it.

To make work portable, start RStudio, go to 'Tools' > 'Global Options' >
'General' and deselect the option 'Restore .RData into workspace at startup'.

Keyboard shortcuts can be modified at 'Tools' > 'Modify Keyboard Shortcuts',
e.g., to change the shortcut 'Run current line or selection' from 'Ctrl+Enter'
to 'Ctrl+R'.

The appearance of code can be changed at 'Tools' > 'Global options' >
'Appearance'. I use Editor fonts 'Consolas', 'Cacadia Mono Light', or
'Lucida Console' with dark Editor theme 'Tomorrow Night Bright' (the default
light theme is 'textmate', another nice light theme is Xcode).

Different fonts can be compared at https://fonts.google.com/, and similarities
between different characters can be checked using the string
1lI|i/ 0ODo S5Z2B8 UVVW uvvw cldrnm __gqy417
consisting of the following numeric (num), lower case (lower), and upper case
(upper) symbols:
num 1, lower L, upper I, vertical bar, lower I, slash /
num 0, upper O, upper D, lower O /
upper S, num 5, upper Z, num 2, upper B, num 8 /
upper U, upper V, upper V, upper double-U /
lower U, lower V, lower V, lower double-U /
lower C, lower L, lower D, lower R, lower N, lower M /
double underscore, lower G, lower Q, lower Y, num 4, num 1, num 7



#### Installing and configuring Rtools ####
Before installing and updating R packages, download the version of Rtools
appropriate for the installed R-version from a CRAN website (see above) via
'Download R for Windows' >' 'Rtools' and set it up using the instructions given
there. Although Rtools is usually not required to install packages from CRAN, it
is needed to install old package versions from CRAN, to install packages from
GitHub that are distributed as source files, and to execute R-scripts that
contain calls to scripts written in compiled code such as C or Fortran to speed
up code execution.
