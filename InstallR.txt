#### Introduction ####
This file contains instructions on installing and configuring R, RStudio, and
RTools on Windows. It also provides an overview of functions to get information
about the used R installation and links to documentation and help on R and
RStudio.


#### Installing and configuring R ####
Select a nearby CRAN mirror website at https://cran.r-project.org/mirrors.html
(see the section 'CRAN mirrors' in the file InstructionsPkgs.txt for some
details) or use the main CRAN page (https://cran.r-project.org/) and download R
via 'Download R for Windows' > 'base' > 'Download R-X.X.X for Windows' and
install it.

R can be configured by changing general options, options for startup, and
options for installing packages, which are documentated at help("options"),
help("Startup"), and help("install.packages"), respectively. For more details,
see the 'R Installation and Administration manual' available at
https://cran.r-project.org/manuals.html.


#### Installing and configuring RStudio ####
RStudio is an integrated development environment for R that can be downloaded
from https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/.

To make work portable, start RStudio, go to 'Tools' > 'Global Options' >
'General' and deselect the option 'Restore .RData into workspace at startup'.

Keyboard shortcuts can be modified at 'Tools' > 'Modify Keyboard Shortcuts',
e.g., to change the shortcut 'Run current line or selection' from 'Ctrl+Enter'
to 'Ctrl+R' so it can be used with one hand.

The appearance of code can be changed at 'Tools' > 'Global options' >
'Appearance'. I use Editor fonts 'Consolas', 'Cacadia Mono Light', or 'Lucida
Console' with dark Editor theme 'Tomorrow Night Bright' (the default light theme
is 'textmate', another nice light theme is Xcode).

To check if characters can be properly distinguished from each other, for
example at https://fonts.google.com/ or https://fonts.adobe.com/, the pangrams
'a quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog' and 'THE QUICK BROWN FOX JUMPS OVER
THE LAZY DOG' can be used for letters. The following string groups together
characters that are similar in appearance and includes numbers and symbols:
71lI|i/ oO0D S5 Z2 B8 ijy4 gq __ UVVW uvvw cldcIdc|dc1d rnm " '' ``

The string consists of the following numeric (num), lower case (lower), and
upper case (upper) characters:
num 7, num 1, lower L, upper I, vertical bar, lower I, slash /
lower O, upper O, num 0, upper D / upper S, num 5 / upper Z, num 2 /
upper B, num 8 / lower I, lower J, lower Y, num 4 / lower G, lower Q /
underscore, underscore / upper U, upper V, upper V, upper double-U /
lower U, lower V, lower V, lower double-U /
lower C, lower L, lower D, lower C, upper I, lower D, lower C, vertical bar,
lower D, lower C, num 1, lower D / lower R, lower N, lower M /
double quotes, single quotes, single quotes, backtick, backtick


#### Installing and configuring Rtools ####
Rtools (the toolchain bundle used for building R packages from source) is needed
to install old package versions from CRAN, to install packages from GitHub that
are distributed as source files, and to execute R-scripts that contain calls to
scripts written in compiled code such as C or Fortran to speed up code
execution.

Before installing or updating R packages that require Rtools, download the
version of Rtools appropriate for the installed R-version from a CRAN website
(see the section 'Installing and configuring R' above) via
'Download R for Windows' > 'Rtools' > 'RTools X.X' and set it up using the
instructions given there.


#### Information about R ####
Information about R and the current R session is provided by various functions:
- .Machine and Sys.info() provide information about the machine and platform R
  is running on.
- .Platform and R.Version() (with the same information in variable R.version)
  provide information about the platform R was built on.
- sessionInfo() provides information about the operating system and R, and gives
  lists of attached and loaded packages. Its printing method provides additional
  information: print(sessionInfo(), locale = TRUE, RNG = TRUE).
- capabilities() and extSoftVersion() provide some details about external
  software that are used or have been installed with R.

How operating systems identify themselves and their versions can be arcane, and
specifically Windows versions might report older versions than the versions that
are actually installed (see the note 'osVersion' in help(sessionInfo) and the
note in help(win.version)).
