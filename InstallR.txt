#### Introduction ####
This file gives instructions for the installing and configuring R, RStudio, and
RTools on Windows. It also includes a check for fonts.



#### Installing R ####
Select a nearby CRAN mirror website at https://cran.r-project.org/mirrors.html
(see the section 'CRAN mirrors' in the file InstructionsPkgs.txt for some
details) or use the main page (https://cran.r-project.org/) and download R via
'Download R for Windows' > 'base' > 'Download R-X.X.X for Windows' and install
it.



#### Installing and configuring RStudio ####
Download RStudio Desktop (https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/) and
install it.

To make work portable, start RStudio, go to 'Tools' > 'Global Options' >
'General' and deselect the option 'Restore .RData into workspace at startup'.

Keyboard shortcuts can be modified at 'Tools' > 'Modify Keyboard Shortcuts',
e.g., to change the shortcut 'Run current line or selection' from 'Ctrl+Enter'
to 'Ctrl+R'.

The appearance of code can be changed at 'Tools' > 'Global options' >
'Appearance'. I use Editor fonts 'Consolas', 'Cacadia Mono Light', or
'Lucida Console' with dark Editor theme 'Tomorrow Night Bright' (the default
light theme is 'textmate', another nice light theme is Xcode).

Different fonts can be compared at https://fonts.google.com/, and similarities
between different characters can be checked using the string
1lI|i/ 0ODo S5Z2B8 UVVW uvvw cldrnm __gqy417
consisting of the following numeric (num), lower case (lower), and upper case
(upper) symbols:
num 1, lower L, upper I, vertical bar, lower I, slash /
num 0, upper O, upper D, lower O /
upper S, num 5, upper Z, num 2, upper B, num 8 /
upper U, upper V, upper V, upper double-U /
lower U, lower V, lower V, lower double-U /
lower C, lower L, lower D, lower R, lower N, lower M /
double underscore, lower G, lower Q, lower Y, num 4, num 1, num 7

Further configuration of R is possible by changing options for startup, general
options, and options for installing packages, documentated at help("Startup"),
help("options"), and help("install.packages"), respectively, and discussed in
the 'R Installation and Administration manual' available at
https://cran.r-project.org/manuals.html.



#### Installing and configuring Rtools ####
Rtools (the toolchain bundle used for building R packages from source) is needed
to install old package versions from CRAN, to install packages from GitHub that
are distributed as source files, and to execute R-scripts that contain calls to
scripts written in compiled code such as C or Fortran to speed up code
execution.

Before installing and updating R packages, download the version of Rtools
appropriate for the installed R-version from a CRAN website (see section
'Installing R' above) via 'Download R for Windows' >' 'Rtools' and set it up
using the instructions given there.
