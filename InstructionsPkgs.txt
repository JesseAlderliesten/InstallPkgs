#### Introduction ####
File with information on installing and getting information about R packages.


#### Installing alternative versions of a package ####
Installing an old version of a package usually requires installation of RTools
to build the packages from source, see the section 'Rtools' in the file
'InstallR.txt'.

The function 'install_version' from the 'remotes' package can be used to
install an old version of a package:
install_version("ggplot2", version = "3.3.4", upgrade = "ask").

Alternatively, for CRAN packages obtain the URL pointing to the desired version
at its CRAN page at 'Downloads > Old sources > pkgs archive' and use this URL:
install.packages("https://cran.r-project.org/src/contrib/Archive/ggplot2/ggplot2_3.3.4.tar.gz",
lib = lib, repos = NULL, type = "source").

Older versions of Bioconductor packages can be found by visiting the appropriate
version of bioconductor, e.g., https://bioconductor.org/packages/3.13/BiocViews.html
(see https://bioconductor.org/about/release-announcements/ for a list of versions
with the corresponding R version).

Versions of CRAN R packages can be compared with diffify (https://diffify.com/)
and an overview of changes in CRAN packages is available at CRANBERRIES:
https://dirk.eddelbuettel.com/cranberries/.


#### Installing task views ####
To install or update all core packages from a CRAN taskview
(https://cran.r-project.org/web/views/) install the package 'ctv' and run
install.views("taskviewname", coreOnly = TRUE) or update.views("taskviewname").


#### CRAN mirrors ####
A list of CRAN mirrors (i.e., websites hosted in various parts of the world with
the same content as the main CRAN website) is available at
https://cran.r-project.org/mirrors.html, and information about their status is
available at https://cran.r-project.org/mirmon_report.html and in the function
getCRANmirrors() from the R-package 'utils'. 


#### Package repositories ####
R packages can be obtained from various repositories, which commonly have
thematic selections of packages as well:
- Bioconductor: https://bioconductor.org/
  (thematic: https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/BiocViews.html#___Software
  also see the biocManager package: https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/BiocManager/)
- https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/index.html
  (thematic: https://cran.r-project.org/web/views/, includes overviews of
  related links and resources; see also the section 'Installing task views' below)
- https://neuroconductor.org/list-packages/all
- https://r-forge.r-project.org/
  (thematic: https://r-forge.r-project.org/softwaremap/trove_list.php)
- https://ropensci.org/packages/all/
  (thematic: https://ropensci.org/packages/)


#### Information about R packages ####
The following websites are useful to obtain information on R packages:
- https://search.r-project.org/ (access from within R using utils::RSiteSearch())
- https://rseek.org/
- METACRAN: https://www.r-pkg.org/ to search in CRAN packages
- R universe: https://r-universe.dev/search/

#### Documentation and help ####
If errors occur when loading packages that require Java, make sure the 64-bit
version of Java is installed on 64-bit PCs. The different versions are
available at https://www.java.com/download/manual.jsp.
