#### Introduction ####
File with information on installing and getting information about R packages.

#### Installing alternative versions of a package ####
To get the version number of an installed package, use
utils::packageVersion("pkgname") (note the package name has to be quoted).

Installing an old version of a package usually requires installation of RTools
to build the packages from source, see the section 'Rtools' in the file
'InstallR.txt'.

The function 'install_version' from the 'remotes' package can be used to
install an old version of a package:
remotes::install_version("ggplot2", version = "3.3.4", upgrade = "ask").

Alternatively, for CRAN packages obtain the URL pointing to the desired version
at its CRAN page at 'Downloads > Old sources > pkgs archive' and use this URL:
install.packages("https://cran.r-project.org/src/contrib/Archive/ggplot2/ggplot2_3.3.4.tar.gz",
lib = lib, repos = NULL, type = "source").

Older versions of Bioconductor packages can be found by visiting the appropriate
version of bioconductor, e.g., https://bioconductor.org/packages/3.16/BiocViews.html
(see https://bioconductor.org/about/release-announcements/ for a list of versions
with the corresponding R version).

Versions of CRAN R packages can be compared with diffify (https://diffify.com/)
and an overview of changes in CRAN packages is available at CRANBERRIES:
https://dirk.eddelbuettel.com/cranberries/.



#### Installing task views ####
To install or update all core packages from a CRAN taskview
(https://cran.r-project.org/web/views/) install the package 'ctv' and run
install.views("taskviewname", coreOnly = TRUE) or update.views("taskviewname").



#### Package repositories ####
R packages can be obtained from various repositories, which commonly have
thematic selections of packages as well:
- Bioconductor: https://bioconductor.org/
  (thematic: https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/BiocViews.html#___Software
  also see the biocManager package: https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/BiocManager/)
- CRAN: https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/index.html
  (thematic: https://cran.r-project.org/web/views/, includes overviews of
  related links and resources; see also the sections 'CRAN mirrors' and
  'Installing task views' below)
- Neuroconductor: https://neuroconductor.org/list-packages/all
- R-Forge: https://r-forge.r-project.org/
  (thematic: https://r-forge.r-project.org/softwaremap/trove_list.php)
- rOpenSci: https://ropensci.org/packages/all/
  (thematic: https://ropensci.org/packages/)



#### CRAN mirrors ####
A list of CRAN mirrors (i.e., websites hosted in various parts of the world with
the same content as the main CRAN website) is available at
https://cran.r-project.org/mirrors.html, and information about their status is
available at https://cran.r-project.org/mirmon_report.html and in the function
getCRANmirrors() from the R-package 'utils'. 



#### Information about not-yet-installed R packages ####
A PDF with all help files of the R standard and recommended packages is
available at https://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/r-release/fullrefman.pdf.

The following websites are useful to obtain information on R packages:
- https://search.r-project.org/ (access from within R using utils::RSiteSearch())
- https://rseek.org/
- METACRAN: https://www.r-pkg.org/ to search in CRAN packages
- R universe: https://r-universe.dev/search/
- R source code: https://github.com/wch/r-source



#### Information about already-installed R packages ####
The code of functions from installed packages can usually be obtained
through getAnywhere("functionname"). If you know which package the
function is in, another option is packagename::functionname (without
adding the brackets that would be added when using a function). For internal
functions three instead of two colons should be used, and one should realise
that internal functions are not guaranteed to stay the same. Of course the
sources given above in the section 'Information about not-yet-installed R
packages' can also be used to obtain information on already-installed R
packages, in particular the source code at https://github.com/wch/r-source
will be useful.

After a package has been loaded (i.e., library(packagename) has been run),
various kinds of information on the package and its functions is available from
within R:
- Display package functions: getNamespaceExports("packagename"),
  ls("package:packagename", all.names = TRUE),
  ls(getNamespace("packagename"))
- Display main help page: help(packagename)
- Display function help pages: help(functionname)
  An operator (e.g., ||) has to be quoted to get its help page: help('||')
- Display function arguments: args(functionname)
- Display installed package version: utils::packageVersion("packagename")

Miscellaneous:
- See the comparison of implementation of functions across packages in the
  'Data Wrangling Functions' repository of CghLewis at
  https://github.com/Cghlewis/data-wrangling-functions
- The function list.functions.in.file() from package 'NCmisc' and the function
  'files_functions() from package 'lares' show all functions used in an R
  script, by package.
- To see which packages are used in a script, look for: library, require,
  requireNamespace, ::. To see which packages are mentioned in comments, look
  for: BioConductor, CRAN, package, StackOverflow.



#### Documentation and help ####
If errors occur when loading packages that require Java, make sure the 64-bit
version of Java is installed on 64-bit PCs. The different versions are
available at https://www.java.com/download/manual.jsp.
